## 👋**Welcome! 👋**

If you are reading these lines... welcome to my profile!

I am a **Data Scientist**, with studies in Robotics and experience as a Project Manager. My analytical approach led me to the world of data, where I firmly believe that the best decisions are based on solid data. I have technical skills to execute complex projects and communicate results clearly.

I am decisive and organized; For example, I developed a Machine Learning model that predicts delays in port merchandise, improving decision making. Additionally, I promote teamwork, considering it essential for the success of any project.
